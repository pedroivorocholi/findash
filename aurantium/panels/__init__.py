"""Built-in aurantium panels.

Normally discovered dynamically (see ``discover_package_panels``). ``BUILTIN``
is an explicit fallback used when dynamic enumeration finds nothing — which is
the case inside a frozen (PyInstaller) build, where the package's modules live
in an archive rather than on disk. Add new built-in panel modules here so they
survive packaging.
