# Releasing Aurantium (with WinSparkle auto-updates)

Aurantium ships updates through [WinSparkle](https://winsparkle.org/). On launch
the app checks an **appcast** feed once a day; when a newer, correctly-signed
installer is available it offers to download and run it. Users click once — no
manual re-install.

This doc has two parts: **one-time setup** (do once), and the **per-release
checklist** (every version).

---

## One-time setup

### 1. Create the public GitHub repo

WinSparkle downloads the appcast and installer over plain HTTPS with **no
authentication**, so both must live in a **public** repo.

```bash
cd app            # the folder that holds aurantium/, installer.iss, appcast.xml
git init
git add .
git commit -m "aurantium 1.0.0"
gh repo create aurantium --public --source=. --push
```

### 2. Point the app at your feed

In `aurantium/updater.py`, set your GitHub username:

```python
GITHUB_USER = "your-actual-username"   # was "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
```

`APPCAST_URL` is derived from it and expects `appcast.xml` at the **repo root**
on the `main` branch. If you keep `appcast.xml` in a subfolder, adjust the URL.

### 3. Install the signing dependency

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # adds cryptography
```

### 4. Generate the signing key (once, ever)

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python tools/gen_keys.py
```

- Writes the **private** key to `tools/eddsa_private.key` — **keep it secret,
  back it up.** It's gitignored. If you lose it, existing users can no longer
  verify updates and you'd have to ship a new public key in a fresh installer.
- Prints the **public** key. Paste the printed line into `aurantium/updater.py`:

  ```python
  EDDSA_PUBLIC_KEY = "…printed value…"
  ```

### 5. Add WinSparkle.dll to the build

Download the latest WinSparkle release zip from
<https://github.com/vslavik/winsparkle/releases>, and copy the **64-bit** DLL
(`x64/WinSparkle.dll` in the zip) to `app/WinSparkle.dll` (next to
`aurantium.spec`). `aurantium.spec` bundles it automatically; it's what
`updater.py` loads at runtime.

> The updater stays fully disabled until `GITHUB_USER` **and**
> `EDDSA_PUBLIC_KEY` are set and the DLL is present — so a half-configured
> build simply runs without updates instead of misbehaving.

---

## Per-release checklist

Say you're going from 1.0.0 → **1.1.0**.

### 1. Bump the version (two files, keep in sync)

- `aurantium/__init__.py` → `__version__ = "1.1.0"`
- `installer.iss` → `AppVersion=1.1.0`

WinSparkle compares `__version__` against the appcast's `sparkle:version`.

### 2. Build the exe and installer

Follow `BUILD.md`:

```bash
.venv/Scripts/pyinstaller aurantium.spec --noconfirm     # -> dist/aurantium.exe
# then compile installer.iss with Inno Setup            -> dist/aurantium-setup.exe
```

### 3. Sign the installer

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python tools/sign_update.py dist/aurantium-setup.exe
```

Note the printed `length:` and `sparkle:edSignature="…"`.

### 4. Update `appcast.xml`

Add a **new `<item>` at the top** (keep older ones for history):

```xml
<item>
  <title>aurantium 1.1.0</title>
  <description><![CDATA[ <ul><li>What changed…</li></ul> ]]></description>
  <pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2026 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
  <enclosure
    url="https://github.com/your-username/aurantium/releases/download/v1.1.0/aurantium-setup.exe"
    sparkle:version="1.1.0"
    sparkle:os="windows"
    sparkle:installerArguments="/VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /FORCECLOSEAPPLICATIONS"
    length="PASTE_LENGTH"
    sparkle:edSignature="PASTE_SIGNATURE"
    type="application/octet-stream" />
</item>
```

- `sparkle:version` must equal `__version__`.
- `url` must match the release tag you create in the next step.
- `pubDate` in RFC-822 (e.g. `date -R`).
- **`sparkle:installerArguments` is required** — it makes WinSparkle run the
  Inno installer silently instead of showing the full setup wizard. `/VERYSILENT`
  hides the UI; `/FORCECLOSEAPPLICATIONS` closes a running Aurantium so its files
  can be replaced. Omit it and every update pops the full wizard.
- **Relaunch** is handled by the installer, not the appcast (WinSparkle does not
  relaunch the app itself, and `/RESTARTAPPLICATIONS` is unreliable). Silent
  auto-updates relaunch from `installer.iss`'s `[Code]` `CurStepChanged` handler,
  which does `Sleep(6000)` then `Exec({app}\aurantium.exe)`. **The delay is
  required:** launched the instant the update finishes, the freshly-written numpy
  C-extension DLLs aren't in place yet and the app crashes with "Importing the
  numpy C-extensions failed" — a slightly later launch works. Interactive installs
  relaunch via the `[Run] … postinstall skipifsilent` entry (no delay needed;
  the Finished page already gives time). Don't add `/RESTARTAPPLICATIONS`.

### 5. Publish the GitHub release

```bash
gh release create v1.1.0 dist/aurantium-setup.exe --title "aurantium 1.1.0" --notes "…"
```

### 6. Push the updated appcast

```bash
git add appcast.xml aurantium/__init__.py installer.iss
git commit -m "aurantium 1.1.0"
git push
```

### 7. Verify

On a machine running the **previous** version, launch Aurantium and pick
**Help ▸ Check for Updates…**. It should find 1.1.0, verify the signature, and
offer to install. (A signature/URL/length mismatch shows a download or
verification error instead — fix the appcast and retry.)

---

## Notes

- **Only the download side must be public.** EdDSA signing — not repo privacy —
  is what keeps updates safe: a tampered installer fails verification and won't
  run.
- **Never regenerate the key** unless you must; it breaks the update path for
  everyone on an older build (they can't verify the new key), forcing a manual
  re-install.
- **macOS** builds don't use WinSparkle; the updater is a no-op there.
